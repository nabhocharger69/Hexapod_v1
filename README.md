SpectreCrawl: Autonomous Stealth Hexapod for Tactical Reconnaissance and Surveillance in Sensitive Border Terrains 

# Concept 
SpectreCrawl is a stealth-capable, bio-inspired hexapod robot designed to perform autonomous and remote surveillance in geopolitically sensitive and high-risk zones, such as the Northeastern borders of India. Built with legged mobility, real-me camera/audio feed, encrypted communication, and GPS-IMU integration, it operates efficiently where conventional wheeled robots fail. This all-terrain, low-visibility robot enhances situational awareness and eliminates human risk in reconnaissance missions. Modular and compact, SpectreCrawl suits both defence and civilian disaster response. It is developed to be cost-effective, rapidly deployable, and capable of scaling into a smart tactical swarm in future iterations.
